# Future Plans

WoodMek isn’t just about early-game mod you use once or twice, there’s much more on the horizon im planning to add. 

## Planned features include:
• **Axe progression overhaul:** introducing stronger, more efficient axes with a meaningful upgrade path  
• **Treecapitator-style mechanics:**  cut entire trees with one swing  
• **No-block tree farming (generators):**  automatic tree growth and harvesting  
• **Auto item pickup:**  seamless integration with existing farms  
• **Late-game wood usage:**  features that give purpose to large stockpiles of wood

These additions aim to make WoodMek a long-term companion in your modpack, especially in mid to late game stages where bulk wood production and usage become key.

## FTB Quests

**Overview**  
<img src="src/main/resources/assets/woodmek/pics (github)/quest.png" alt="quests" width="400">  
*With any new mod/modpack, a quest is needed and so using FTB quests. Iv created just that.*

**Quest Item**  
<img src="src/main/resources/assets/woodmek/pics (github)/quest1.png" alt="quest item" width="400">  
*With each item, comes a description and a linear progression to help players know what steps to take to get to each milestone with custom rewards!*
